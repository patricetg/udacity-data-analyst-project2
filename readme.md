We are planing to invest in the movies business, so our aim is to understand the sector in order to know what are the best investment options available to us.   
In this project, we will be analyzing data associated with The Movie Database (TMDb), including budget, production companies, and revenue, which contains information about 10,000 movies. In particular, we will be interested in :
1. Which genre of movies are on trend, so that we define the direction of our investment ?  
1. What is the minimum amount of budget we should allocate to the choosen movie genre, in order to score in the highest movie revenues ?
1. Which companies are the best in the genre of movie we are targeting ?
1. Does having a website for the genre that is of interest to us help improve revenue ?

There are two ipynb files : one that is my draft (it has "draft" in its name) and one that is the report (it is the one I am submiting)
